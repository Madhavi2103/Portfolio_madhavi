            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am an aspiring web developer, currently pursuing my degree in Master of Computer Application at Koneru Lakshmaiah Education Foundation(Deemed to be University). With a strong interest in software development, I am eager to apply the knowledge and skills I've gained through my coursework and projects to real-world challenges. <br><br>
                Throughout my academic journey, I have developed proficiency in HTML, CSS, programming languages like Java and JavaScript, and have completed several hands-on projects, including Custom online booking system(Bus booking), developing a personal website. These experiences have helped me sharpen my problem-solving abilities and foster creativity. <br><br>

                <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An Online Bus Booking System is a web application designed to simplify the process of reserving bus tickets for travelers. Built using HTML and CSS, this system provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to select their departure and destination cities, choose travel dates, and specify seat preferences. The booking form typically includes dropdown menus for city selections and date pickers for easy navigation. <br><br>
                    By utilizing HTML for the structure of the web pages and CSS for styling, the application ensures a visually appealing layout, enhancing user experience. Users can easily navigate through the booking process, making it straightforward to find and book their desired routes. Additionally, the system may include features such as real-time seat availability, pricing information, and confirmation details. This approach not only streamlines the booking process but also empowers users to plan their travels efficiently, reducing the time and effort traditionally associated with ticket reservations. <br>
                    Overall, the Online Bus Booking System represents a modern solution for hassle-free travel planning.</p>
